##Getting-CleaningData
====================
##ReadMe file for the Course Project of Getting & Cleaning Data

Repo contains run_analysis.R, ReadMe file and a code book(CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
